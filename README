worm tracking & motion analysis

== usage

1. put avi's in an input/ directory

2. copy RULES.sample.json to RULES.json and adjust as needed

3. watchworm all


== wishlist

+ [ok] Allow worms that go on or off the screen; use for speed, if not distance.

+ Two worms in a single circle ?! How to deal with occlusion

+ How to characterize motion?

+ [ok] Add standard deviation

- [ok] Kill the rest of the codebase

- [ok] Make a CLI utility instead of using Makefiles

  - [ok] all
  - [ok] clean

- [ok] Drop numm dependency
  - (TODO) convert all functions to be generator-based
  - [ok] use opencv to serialize to/from avi

- Generate test worm patterns to develop new features
  - [ok] basic
  - [ok] start off screen
  - worm shape
  - occlusion
